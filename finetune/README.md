## Structure
- `scripts/`   : entry scripts to launch fine-tuning
- `configs/`   : example training configs
- `data/`      : (local path placeholder, do NOT commit raw data)

- `logs/`      : training logs / tensorboard

> Large artifacts (weights, datasets) must NOT be committed. Consider Git LFS or external storage.
